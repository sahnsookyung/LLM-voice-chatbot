- There's a problem with the speech TTS only happening after the text has been produced from the LLM.
This needs to be streamed so the conversation latency is reduced.

- Using RealtimeSTT for faster voice input?

- At some point package things into separate docker applications, maybe? Not sure if this is best though, need more research.

- Create a requirements.txt or some sort like that, apparently poetry might be better as generating one specifies with too low of an LOD.

- Create a Readme.md
